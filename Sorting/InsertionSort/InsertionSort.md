# Insertion Sort
- Logic
    - Assume that first element is sorted
    - Compare sorted element with each element on the left of it until an element smaller than it is found
    - Place unsorted element after smallest element found
    - if none found place it at the beginning of the sorted array
- Time Complexity
    - O(n^2)
    - Not efficient in time complexity, but can be efficient if the array is semi-sorted
- Space Complexity
    - O(1)
