   - Divide and conquer. Merge sort operation follows the basis of dividing the list into halves and continuously dividing the new halves down to their individual component. Then there is a comparison between individual components, which are merged to form the final sorted list.
- Time Complexity
    - O(n Log(n))

- Space Complexity
    - O(n)
